# Mobile Sensors Workshop

The workshop will cover the basics of the most popular types of sensors used in mobile applications. You will learn about different type of sensors that are often useful in mobile applications, from simple light and temperature sensors to more complex sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes. The Arduino platform will provide a handy tool for recording the sensor output and presenting Then each student will have the opportunity to build a sensor-enabled device with the Arduino platform. 

## Curriculum

We'll be covering the following topics:

### First day -- analog
* Sensor introduction
* Sensing effects
* Sensor circuits
* Force and position
* Light and temperature
* Sampling & Digital Conversion

### Second Day -- digital
* Using I2C
* Accelerometers
* Gyroscopes
* Magnetometers
* Design & build

### Things to know ahead of time

You don't strictly need to know any of these things, but they will help
* Basic electronics -- resistors, capacitors, op amps, diodes, and the like
* Basic Arduino programming
