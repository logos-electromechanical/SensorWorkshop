# Mobile Sensors Workshop

The workshop will cover the basics of the most popular types of sensors used in mobile and wearable applications: force, position, light, temperature, tilt, compasses, and more. These types of sensors can enable you to build things from an automatic night light to a robot capable of navigating through a room on its own. The Arduino platform will provide a handy tool for recording, analyzing, presenting, and acting on the sensor output. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to build a sensor-enabled device with the Arduino platform. 

## Curriculum

We'll be covering the following topics:

### First day -- analog
* Sensor introduction
* Sensing effects
* Sensor circuits
* Force and position sensors
* Light and temperature sensors
* Sampling & Digital Conversion

### Second Day -- digital
* Using I2C
* Accelerometers
* Gyroscopes
* Magnetometers
* Design & build

### Things to know ahead of time

You don't need to know any of these things, but they will help you in this workshop.

* Basic electronics -- resistors, capacitors, op amps, diodes, and the like
* Basic Arduino programming
